# Meross2Domoticz
NodeJS bridge between Meross IOT and Domoticz<br />
Only works with MSS310 for the moment<br />

## Credits
It is based on the Meross-Cloud work by Apollon77
https://github.com/Apollon77/meross-cloud

## Setup in Domoticz
The UUID of the Plug must be set in the derscription of the Domoticz element (which as a link between Domoticz and Meross)<br />
For the control, it needs to be a 'On/Off' type.<br />
For the power consumption, it needs to be a 'General' type.<br />

## Todo
Update code to work with MSS210 & MSS425.<br />

# Meross2Domoticz
NodeJS bridge between Meross IOT and Domoticz
Only works with MSS310 for the moment

## Credits
It is based on the Meross-Cloud work by Apollon77
https://github.com/Apollon77/meross-cloud

## Setup in Domoticz
The UUID of the Plug must be set in the derscription of the Domoticz element (which as a link between Domoticz and Meross)
For the control, it needs to be a 'On/Off' type.
For the power consumption, it needs to be a 'General' type.

## Todo
Update code to work with MSS210 & MSS425.
